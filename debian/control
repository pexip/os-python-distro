Description: Linux OS platform information API
 distro (for: Linux Distribution) provides information about the Linux
 distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version
 information.
 .
 It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's original
 platform.linux_distribution function, but it also provides much more
 functionality which isn't necessarily Python bound like a command-line
 interface.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the library.
